# Product Finder

The app is a data table with a few select widgets and a search input. 
Selecting an option or multiple options from the widget should filter the table data accordingly. 
The search input should filter the table on the fund name column. 
Youâ€™d also need to come up with a suitable representation/format for the data used by the various widgets.
